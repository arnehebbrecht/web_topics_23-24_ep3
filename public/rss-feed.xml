    <title>OpenAi</title>
    <link>https://chatgpt.com/</link>
    <description>
      ChatGPT was used for much of this project. So many of these topics I have never really had to apply. This made it quite a difficult learning curve. 
      This made it cost me a lot of time. But i think i made the best of it with my limited experience in web design.

      GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) was fun to tinker a bit with. It is a powerful tool that I will definitely use again. It's also pretty easy to use. Once you 
      understand the basics, you can create some pretty cool animations.
